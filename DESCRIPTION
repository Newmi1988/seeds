Description: Algorithms to calculate the hidden inputs of systems of differential equations. 
  These hidden inputs can be interpreted as a control that tries to minimize the
  discrepancies between a given model and taken measurements. The idea is 
  also called the Dynamic Elastic Net, as proposed in the paper "Learning (from) the errors of a systems biology model"
