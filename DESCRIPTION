Title: Estimate Hidden Inputs using the Method of the Dynamic Elastic Net
Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: c(person("Tobias", "Newmiwaka", email = "tobias.newmiwaka@gmail.com",
                  role = c("aut", "cre")),
            person("Benjamin", "Engelhardt", email = "engelhar@bit.uni-bonn.de", 
                    role = c("aut")))
Description: Algorithms to calculate the hidden inputs of systems of differential equations. 
  These hidden inputs can be interpreted as a control that tries to minimize the
  discrepancies between a given model and taken measurements. The method is 
  also called the 'dynamic elastic net'.
