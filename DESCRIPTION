Title: Estimating hidden inputs that indicate errors in the model equation
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Tobias Newmiwaka
Maintainer: Tobias N. <tobias.newmiwaka@gmail.com>
Description: A package combining two different algorithms for calculating hidden
  inputs. These hidden inputs can be interpreted as a controll that tries to minimize the
  discrepancies between a given model and a given measurements. The method is 
  also called the 'dynamic elastic net'. The related work can be found in doi:10.1038/srep20772
